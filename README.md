Vasilij
=======
MUH gallery, MUH nodejs, MUH backbone, MUH MIT, MUH mainstream!

Let's say I needed a nice UI to manage the images stored in my server and the previous software I used is actually a bunch of shit.
And let's say, too, that someone told me I should use more mainstream languages.

What it does
------------
After having configured `config.js`, *Vasilij* prints a JSON containing the directory tree of given path, making eventually thumbnails for folders which have no one.

*Improvisation* makes a grid with these infos with some wizardries and... that's it.

Usage
-----
`$ npm install`

`$ npm start`
